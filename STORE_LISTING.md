## Detailed description (max 16,000 characters)

**Attention Guard** is a focus and productivity extension that stays out of your way until you need it.

**What it does**
- **Floating timer** – Draggable panel with a Pomodoro-style countdown. Set session length, break length, and number of blocks (e.g. 3 blocks of 25 min work + 5 min break).
- **Persistent across tabs** – Timer and panel position sync across all your Chrome windows and tabs.
- **Panic button** – One click opens a custom overlay with your own reminders, optional image, and optional audio. Use it to pause and refocus without losing your place.
- **Optional URL blocking** – In Settings you can add sites to block during work sessions. On those sites, the page is blurred and media muted; the timer panel stays usable. Blocking turns off during breaks and when the extension is off.
- **No account, no server** – Everything is stored locally in your browser. No login, no analytics, no data sent to us or anyone else.

**How to use**
1. Install the extension and click its icon to show the timer panel.
2. Adjust Session, Break, and Blocks in Settings if you like.
3. Press Start to begin a work block. When it ends, a short sound plays and the break countdown starts automatically.
4. Use the Panic button when you need to pause and read your reminders; “Back to focus” resumes the timer from where it stopped.
5. Minimize the panel to a small bar, or disable it from the Panic screen (“I quit”) until you click the extension icon again.

**Permissions**
- **Storage** – Saves your settings and timer state on your device only.
- **Run on all sites** – So the timer and panel can appear on any page you choose. No page content is sent anywhere.

For more details and the full privacy policy, see the extension folder or the developer’s repository.
