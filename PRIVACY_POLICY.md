# Privacy Policy – Attention Guard

**Last updated:** February 2025

## 1. Overview

**Attention Guard** ("the extension") is a Chrome browser extension that helps you stay focused using a Pomodoro-style timer and optional website blocking during work sessions. This privacy policy describes how the extension handles data and what permissions it uses.

## 2. Data storage

- **Local storage only.** All data is stored on your device using Chrome’s local storage (`chrome.storage.local`). Nothing is sent to our servers or any third party.
- **Data stored may include:**
  - Timer state (e.g. remaining time, current block, work/break mode)
  - Your settings (session length, break length, number of blocks, panel position, minimized state)
  - Custom "panic" content (title, reminder text, optional image or audio you add in settings)
  - List of URLs you choose to block during work sessions

## 3. Data we do not collect

- We do not collect personal data.
- We do not use analytics or tracking.
- We do not send any data over the network for this extension.
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties.

## 4. Permissions

- **Storage:** Used only to save and read the data listed above on your device.
- **Tabs:** Used only to sync the "Panic" modal state across browser tabs (e.g. closing it in one tab closes it in others).
- **Host access (all_urls):** Used to show the timer panel on web pages and, when you enable it, to display a blocking overlay and mute media only on the URLs you added to your block list. No page content or URLs are sent to us or to any server.

## 5. Changes

If we change this policy, we will update the "Last updated" date and, where relevant, describe the change in the extension or on the Chrome Web Store listing.

## 6. Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or the extension, you can contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store listing or the project repository on GitHub.
